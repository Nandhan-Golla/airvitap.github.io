# Hi! I am **Surya**

I’m super passionate about learning and consuming knowledge like it’s food. Just like how food keeps you going, knowledge fuels my curiosity and drives me to keep learning every day. I believe that there’s always something new to discover, and I love diving into all kinds of fields, including:

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
- **Robotics**
- **Aerospace Engineering**

For me, learning isn’t just about reading books or memorizing facts. It’s an ongoing journey where I’m always exploring new ideas and figuring out how things work. I’m all about reading **research papers**, testing out new concepts, and building things that can solve real-world problems.

What excites me the most is being able to combine my creative ideas with hands-on skills. Whether I’m coding, building prototypes, or just experimenting with new tech, I’m all about making stuff that actually makes a difference.

#### Let's Build Something Amazing!

I’m always looking for new ways to collaborate, learn, and innovate. If you share similar interests or want to talk about cool projects or ideas, feel free to reach out!
