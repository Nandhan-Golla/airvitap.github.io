I'm a second-year undergraduate with a passion for exploring the intersection of machine learning (ML) and cybersecurity. 
I’m fascinated by how ML can be leveraged to enhance security systems, detect threats, and protect digital environments from evolving cyber risks. My academic journey has sparked my curiosity in developing innovative solutions that combine data-driven insights with robust cybersecurity practices.
When I’m not studying or tinkering with code, I enjoy diving into the latest research, experimenting with algorithms, and staying ahead of the curve in this dynamic field
